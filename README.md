# Travelling Salesperson Project

Used Eitan solution for HW9; (I think mine is 100% fine but why play with fire?)

All build files end up in `cmake-build-debug/` (which is .gitignored), so `speed.tsv` and `shortest.tsv` were manually copied from there to root. (Generated files which the assignment asks for must b manually copied to root).
